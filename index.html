    <h2>Words I Never Said</h2>
    <p>[Skylar Grey]
        It’s so loud Inside my head
        With words that I should have said!
        As I drown in my regrets
        I can’t take back the words I never said
        I can’t take back the words I never said
    </p>
    <p>[Lupe Fiasco]
        I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
        Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
        How much money does it take to really make a full clip
        9/11 building 7 did they really pull it
        Uhh, And a bunch of other cover ups
        Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
        If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
        The school was garbage in the first place, thats on the up and up
        Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the uppercrust
        You get it then they move you so you never keeping up enough
        If you turn on TV all you see’s a bunch of “what the f-cks”
        Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
        And that aint Jersey Shore, homie thats the news
        And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth
        Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
        Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
        Thats why I aint vote for him, next one either
        I’ma part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
        And I believe in the people.
